# perfectNumber
This is my solution for the https://edabit.com/challenge/vXYP24qRoQQijc834 challenge.

## The Challenge:
Create a function that tests whether or not an integer is a perfect number. A perfect number is a number that can be written as the sum of its factors, excluding the number itself.
